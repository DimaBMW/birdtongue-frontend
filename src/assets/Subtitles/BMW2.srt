turbo V8 however it's been tuned by

evolve Automotive as a result it now has

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,780
750 horsepower and 1000 newton meters of

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,640
torque drives all four wheels for an

17
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,100
8-speed automatic gearbox with launch

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,640
control it weighs in at just under

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,200
1.9 tons let's find out about the

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,360
Mercedes from its driver it's racing

Mercedes E63 I have got 810 horsepower

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,459
it's been MSL tuned which is basically

26
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,159
an ECU remap it's just under two tons so

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,260
it's a little bit heavy nine speed Auto

28
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,540
gearbox yeah should be fun and how much

29
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,760
torque is your four liter twin turbo V8

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,460
putting out my 4-liter twin turbo V8 is

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,680
putting out 1 000 newton meters of

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
torque do you see how I like managed to

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,820
just bring in the size of the engine

34
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,740

first of all

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,540

RS6 4 liter twin turbo V8

42
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,659

43
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,579

44
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,200

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,799
drag race but before we do we're gonna

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,119

[Music]

52

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,080

57
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,120

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,220
and your Mercedes Samuel

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,420

60
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,800
nice on the overrip though it kind of

61
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,620
pops and bangs yeah

138
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,000
minutes later rather than do the whole

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,180
money thing for this bet let's have it

140
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,380
the loser

141
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,120
has to for the following races and

142
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,660
challenges have their driving seat in my

143
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,580
driving position and we all

144
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,639
we all am short and I sit too close to

145
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,139
the wheel so for the rest of the video

146
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,479
whoever loses between you two I will

147
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,039
come into your car set up your driving

148
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,539
position and you'll have to have it like

149
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,000
that for the rest of the video okay okay

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,460
but sounds shorter than me but okay

151
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,800
that's still fine didn't you say I sit

152
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,539
really far back though remember that

153
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,220
last day so I think it'll balance out

154
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,139
won't it you do you sit quite far back

155
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,120
like racing driver thing and I will set

156
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,520
it in a position that I deem appropriate

157
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,039
regardless okay so let's get on with

158
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,340
this race

159
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,500

163
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,680
might just set up Charlie's driving

164
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,560
position

165
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,099
[Music]

166
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,560

a little Irish leprechaun right so Sam

185
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,080
you're used to me in my driving position

186
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,880
because you instruct me so let's just

187
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,320
make sure it's fair absolutely right

188
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,660
yeah so I'd like to be quite close very

189
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,180
close it's safer because there's got to

190
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,440
be a bend in your legs and your elbows

191
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,480
remember we discussed that yeah so that

192
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,160
feels about right the back rest you

193
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,180
normally have it higher because your

194
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,040
helmet don't you so

195
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,440
that's about right I feel really comfy

196
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,820
actually yeah it looks comfy that's

197
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,519
that's a good position the whole rest of

198
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,540
the video the entire video what actually

199
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,700
let's get the lumbar support in as well

200
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,779
get some of that in because you need

201
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,820
that because the lateral support is

202
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,380
important yeah let's get all that like

203
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,760
that's that's there as well

204
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,920
come on I want to watch this come on we

205
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,380
might need to push him in there come on

206
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,660
there it is there it is

207
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,839
no no wait I've seen some more

208
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,480
belt on Yanni's Safety First

209
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,100
you do not want that airbag to go off

210
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,360
what's yeah what's going on

211
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,920
right you can't move it all right

212
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,920
he looks really uncomfortable

213
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,180
you look good

214
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,160
perfect driving position look at my arms

215
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,899
right is everyone sitting comfortably

216
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,060
with a rolling race 50 miles an hour

217
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,920
causing Comfort mode automatic mode

218
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,240
Let's see what happens

219
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,100
three two one go

220
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,200
oh hello come on in my new driving

221
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,560
position

222
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,560
okay

223
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,519
[Applause]

224
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,320
I think your response is slightly

225
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,940
quicker than Jan when you're closer to

226
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,200
the wheel maybe that's what you've been

227
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,600
going wrong all these years yeah exactly

228
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,980
me exactly what I've been got yeah

229
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,320
exactly mate

230
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,060
are you putting the window down because

231
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,560
you're sweating it's hot in here man

232
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,339
it's hot Sam it was a loss for you

233
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,380
wasn't it but you still feel like you're

234
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,360
winning right yeah I'm winning in every

235
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,160
way but on track which is standard for

236
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,260
me anyway this had a really slow

237
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,000
lethargic kick down it'll be interesting

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,399
to see how it does in the manual race

239
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,839
because it you didn't get me but the

240
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,519
launch I just off the kick down you both

241
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,320
beat me well let's do that right now

242
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,060
then okay so now we're gonna do the

243
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,399
rolling race again 50 miles an hour over

244
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,800
the half mile this time no sportier

245
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,079
settings and manual mode third gear roll

246
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,680
on here we go three two one go

247
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,839
oh that RS6 shot off

248
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,779
in fact I'm losing

249
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,100
so I'm coming back but will I come back

250
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,060
oh

251
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:54,600
oh that was interesting that is where

252
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,399
you see the range Source mate that's

253
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,040
where it is mid-range real good I think

254
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,959
I might have just picked him at the line

255
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,779
you might have but that was that would

256
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,640
the cars finally turned up finally

257
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,200
finally how about you Sam what have you

258
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,180
got to say for yourself I mean it shot

259
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,279
off pretty well no to be fair Yanni's

260
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,079
shot off a little bit ahead of mine and

261
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,760
then there was like I don't know 200

262
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,200
yards where it was just gapping me and

263
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,399
then it leveled out so you're right it's

264
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,899
that mid-range yeah and that that's just

265
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,240
got lots of power yeah this thing like

266
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,240
the response wasn't great but once it's

267
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,760
found it's like legs it just absolutely

268
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,680
rocket and a real viewing and then I

269
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,720
think I just beat yanny on the line you

270
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,160
know enjoy the next test a lot though

271
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,260
Yanni because it's the brake test it's

272
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,899
gonna be really really Pleasant for you

273
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,000
but let's do it anyway when we reach the

274
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,040
line for emergency stop which car will

275
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,380
stop in the shortest distance and is he

276
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,760
only too close to the steering wheel

277
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,430
with find out

278
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,550
[Applause]

279
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,260
this one then the Audi and then the

280
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,600
Mercedes which is basically what has

281
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,079
happened in every other event except for

282
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,480
the one that mattered where I lost the

283
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,180
mat we must see it's like unbelievable

284
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,579
what's it like in that position is it a

285
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,139
horrendous was it hard to do the brake

286
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,899
test to be for it's not that bad but

287
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,120
yeah I feel very close to this steering

288
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,200
wheel I'm very conscious of the fact

289
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,940
that I'm steering wheel on windscreens

290
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,279
are very close Sam it wouldn't be a

291
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,200
cowboy drag race video if we didn't have

292
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,060
some excuses from you so what are your

293
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,760
final excuses for the day the bunny ears

294
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,740
there is an extra spoiler on the back of

295
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,420
this which is creating a lot of drag so

296
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,279
that's one hindrance and I think I was

297
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,380
on the bumpy side of the surface for

298
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,060
breaking but that's it I'll take that

299
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,339
that's fine perfect excuses I think

300
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:46,860
they're all completely invalid anyway if

301
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,540
you're after a high performance car and

302
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,920
you want to spend a little bit less than

303
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,540
