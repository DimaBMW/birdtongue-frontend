evolve Automotive as a result it now has

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.680
750 horsepower and 1000 newton meters of

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.540
torque drives all four wheels for an

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000
8-speed automatic gearbox with launch

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.540
control it weighs in at just under

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.100
1.9 tons let's find out about the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.260
Mercedes from its driver it's racing

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.439
Mercedes E63 I have got 810 horsepower

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359
it's been MSL tuned which is basically

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.059
an ECU remap it's just under two tons so

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.160
it's a little bit heavy nine speed Auto

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440
gearbox yeah should be fun and how much

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.660
torque is your four liter twin turbo V8

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.360
putting out my 4-liter twin turbo V8 is

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.580
putting out 1 000 newton meters of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.220
torque do you see how I like managed to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.720
just bring in the size of the engine

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.640

rear window why didn't you mention them

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.860
first of all

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.440
are they part of the tuning upgrade I

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.780

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.920
RS6 4 liter twin turbo V8

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.100
told so this should be quick all-wheel

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.040
drive 8-speed 2.1 tons and it's around

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.600
93

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.540
000 pounds let's see what happens in a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.699
drag race but before we do we're gonna

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.019
do the sound check I'm going to rev up

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.620
this BMW

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.680
[Music]

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.260
now I've got a soft limiter at 5000 RPM

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.980
but this still

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.920
sounds pretty epic how about you yanny

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.520
pops and bangs yeah

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.499

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.719

way up the runway and all the way back

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.300
down again to just re-engage launch

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.760

confident but you will not beat me let's

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.920

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.200

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.340
run up there by the time we get back

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.319
down matt will come out of a plan a few

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.900
minutes later rather than do the whole

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.080
money thing for this bet let's have it

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.280
the loser

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.020
has to for the following races and

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.560
challenges have their driving seat in my

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.480
driving position and we all

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.539
we all am short and I sit too close to

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.039
the wheel so for the rest of the video

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.379
whoever loses between you two I will

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:43.939
come into your car set up your driving

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.439
position and you'll have to have it like

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.900
that for the rest of the video okay okay

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.360
but sounds shorter than me but okay

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.700
that's still fine didn't you say I sit

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.439
really far back though remember that

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.120
last day so I think it'll balance out

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.039
won't it you do you sit quite far back

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:00.020
like racing driver thing and I will set

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.420
it in a position that I deem appropriate

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.939
regardless okay so let's get on with

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.240
this race

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.400
don't believe it I don't believe it

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:25.300
oh that was said it's got a good launch

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.439
[Music]

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:31.300
the launch is dead on this man

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.580
might just set up Charlie's driving

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.460
position

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.999
[Music]

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:49.460
uh stewards can we check if he jumped

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.700
please

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.620
[Music]

00:07:56.819 --> 00:07:58.580
well there you go yanny unfortunately

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.680
you're lost which means I'm going to

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.599
need to reset your driving position but

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:05.840
before I do that let's do the thing so

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.080
then what exactly happened well the BMW

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.360
won it completed the standing quarter

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.599
mile with a time of 10.5 seconds the

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:17.300
Mercedes took 10.8 seconds to do the

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.760
quarter mile the Audi was just behind

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.960
with a time of 10.9 seconds right now we

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.999
get into the rolling race but before we

00:08:26.099 --> 00:08:29.480
do that let me reset janny's driving

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.840
position

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.318
thank you

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.600
oh my God look at this city as well like

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.420
a little Irish leprechaun right so Sam

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.980
you're used to me in my driving position

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.780
because you instruct me so let's just

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.220
make sure it's fair absolutely right

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.560
yeah so I'd like to be quite close very

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.080
close it's safer because there's got to

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.340
be a bend in your legs and your elbows

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.380
remember we discussed that yeah so that

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.060
feels about right the back rest you

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.080
normally have it higher because your

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.940
helmet don't you so

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.340
that's about right I feel really comfy

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.720
actually yeah it looks comfy that's

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.419
that's a good position the whole rest of

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:09.440
the video the entire video what actually

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.600
let's get the lumbar support in as well

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.679
get some of that in because you need

00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:14.720
that because the lateral support is

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.280
important yeah let's get all that like

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.660
that's that's there as well

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.820
come on I want to watch this come on we

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.280
might need to push him in there come on

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.560
there it is there it is

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.739
no no wait I've seen some more

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:44.380
belt on Yanni's Safety First

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.000
you do not want that airbag to go off

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.260
what's yeah what's going on

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.820
right you can't move it all right

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.820
he looks really uncomfortable

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.080
you look good

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.060
perfect driving position look at my arms

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.799
right is everyone sitting comfortably

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:05.960
with a rolling race 50 miles an hour

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.820
causing Comfort mode automatic mode

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.140
Let's see what happens

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.000
three two one go

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.100
oh hello come on in my new driving

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.460
position

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.460
okay

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.419
[Applause]

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:43.220
I think your response is slightly

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.840
quicker than Jan when you're closer to

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.100
the wheel maybe that's what you've been

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.500
going wrong all these years yeah exactly

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.880
me exactly what I've been got yeah

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.220
exactly mate

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.960
are you putting the window down because

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.460
you're sweating it's hot in here man

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.239
it's hot Sam it was a loss for you

00:10:59.339 --> 00:11:01.280
wasn't it but you still feel like you're

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.260
winning right yeah I'm winning in every

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.060
way but on track which is standard for

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.160
me anyway this had a really slow

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.900
lethargic kick down it'll be interesting

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.299
to see how it does in the manual race

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:12.739
because it you didn't get me but the

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.419
launch I just off the kick down you both

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.220
beat me well let's do that right now

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.960
then okay so now we're gonna do the

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.299
rolling race again 50 miles an hour over

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:22.700
the half mile this time no sportier

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.979
settings and manual mode third gear roll

00:11:25.079 --> 00:11:28.580
on here we go three two one go

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.739
oh that RS6 shot off

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.679
in fact I'm losing

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.000
so I'm coming back but will I come back

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.960
oh

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:54.500
oh that was interesting that is where

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.299
you see the range Source mate that's

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.940
where it is mid-range real good I think

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.859
I might have just picked him at the line

00:12:00.959 --> 00:12:03.679
you might have but that was that would

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:05.540
the cars finally turned up finally

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.100
finally how about you Sam what have you

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.080
got to say for yourself I mean it shot

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.179
off pretty well no to be fair Yanni's

00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:12.979
shot off a little bit ahead of mine and

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:14.660
then there was like I don't know 200

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.100
yards where it was just gapping me and

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.299
then it leveled out so you're right it's

00:12:17.399 --> 00:12:18.799
that mid-range yeah and that that's just

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:21.140
got lots of power yeah this thing like

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.140
the response wasn't great but once it's

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.660
found it's like legs it just absolutely

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.580
rocket and a real viewing and then I

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.620
think I just beat yanny on the line you

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.060
know enjoy the next test a lot though

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
Yanni because it's the brake test it's

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.799
gonna be really really Pleasant for you

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:38.900
but let's do it anyway when we reach the

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.940
line for emergency stop which car will

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.280
stop in the shortest distance and is he

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.660
only too close to the steering wheel

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.330
with find out

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.450
[Applause]

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.160
this one then the Audi and then the

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.500
Mercedes which is basically what has

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.979
happened in every other event except for

00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:09.380
the one that mattered where I lost the

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.080
mat we must see it's like unbelievable

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.479
what's it like in that position is it a

00:13:14.579 --> 00:13:16.039
horrendous was it hard to do the brake

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:18.799
test to be for it's not that bad but

00:13:18.899 --> 00:13:21.020
yeah I feel very close to this steering

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.100
wheel I'm very conscious of the fact

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.840
that I'm steering wheel on windscreens

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.179
are very close Sam it wouldn't be a

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:28.100
cowboy drag race video if we didn't have

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.960
some excuses from you so what are your

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.660
final excuses for the day the bunny ears

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.640
there is an extra spoiler on the back of

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.320
this which is creating a lot of drag so

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.179
that's one hindrance and I think I was

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:40.280
on the bumpy side of the surface for

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.960
breaking but that's it I'll take that

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.239
that's fine perfect excuses I think

00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:46.760
they're all completely invalid anyway if

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.440
you're after a high performance car and

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.820
you want to spend a little bit less than

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.440
